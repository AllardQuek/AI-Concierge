# 🎯 Simple Free Deployment for Sybil POC

## TL;DR: Two Free Options

### 🆓 Option 1: Render + Vercel (100% Free)
**Best for:** POC, testing, demos  
**Limitation:** Backend sleeps after 15min (30sec cold start)

1. **Backend:** Deploy to [Render.com](https://render.com) (free)
2. **Frontend:** Deploy to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) (free)  
3. **Guide:** `DEPLOY-FREE-RENDER.md`

### 💰 Option 2: Railway + Vercel ($5/month)  
**Best for:** Development, always-on testing  
**Limitation:** $5/month for backend (free tier)

1. **Backend:** Deploy to [Railway.app](https://railway.app) ($5 credits)
2. **Frontend:** Deploy to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) (free)
3. **Guide:** `DEPLOY.md`

## 🚀 Recommended for POC: Render

Since you mentioned this is a POC, **Render is perfect**:

- ✅ **$0 cost** - completely free
- ✅ **Easy deployment** - connects to GitHub  
- ✅ **HTTPS included** - required for WebRTC
- ⚠️ **15min sleep** - but wakes up in ~30 seconds

For a POC where you're doing demos or testing occasionally, the 30-second cold start is totally acceptable.

## 📋 Quick Start with Render

1. **Follow:** `DEPLOY-FREE-RENDER.md` (step-by-step guide)
2. **Total time:** ~10 minutes  
3. **Cost:** $0
4. **Result:** Working voice chat platform

## 🔄 Easy Migration Path

Start with Render (free), then upgrade when needed:

1. **Start:** Render (free) → Test your POC
2. **Upgrade:** Railway ($5/month) → For development  
3. **Scale:** Dedicated hosting → For production

## 💡 Bottom Line

**For POC testing:** Use Render (free)  
**For active development:** Consider Railway ($5/month)  
**For production:** Plan for dedicated hosting

Your Sybil platform will work great on either option! 🎉
