## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### System Components

      │                                        │
      │                                        │
      └────► Socket.IO Signaling Server ◄──────┘

                 WebRTC Negotiation
                 ICE Candidate Exchange
                 Call State Management
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Peer-to-Peer Audio** - Direct WebRTC connection for minimal latency
2. **Signaling Only Backend** - Server only handles call setup, not audio
3. **Single-Page Experience** - All call states managed in one interface
4. **Mobile-First Design** - Works seamlessly on mobile browsers
5. **Simple Phone System** - Singapore numbers for easy demo and testing

## 🔄 WebRTC P2P Audio Flow Explained

### What Happens During a Call

1. **Signaling Phase (Through Server)**:
   ```
   Caller ← Socket.IO → Server ← Socket.IO → Receiver
   ```
   - **Call initiation** (`call-user` event)
   - **WebRTC offer/answer** exchange 
   - **ICE candidates** for NAT traversal
   - **Call status** updates (answered, declined, ended)

2. **Audio Data Phase (Direct P2P)**:
   ```
   Caller ←── WebRTC Direct ──→ Receiver
         (Real-time audio stream)
   ```
   - ✅ **Audio data** flows directly between browsers
   - ✅ **No server involvement** in audio transmission
   - ✅ **Ultra-low latency** (<50ms typical)
   - ✅ **End-to-end encryption** (WebRTC DTLS/SRTP)

### Benefits of This Architecture

- **Lower Latency**: Audio doesn't bounce through server
- **Better Quality**: No server-side audio processing/compression
- **Scalability**: Server only handles lightweight signaling
- **Privacy**: Audio never touches the server
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Server doesn't handle audio data

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm run install:all  # Install all dependencies
```

### 2. **Start Development**
```bash
npm run dev          # Start both client and server
```

### 3. **Test the Application**
- Open two browser tabs/devices to `http://localhost:3000`
- Each tab gets a unique Singapore phone number (+65 XXXX XXXX)
- Enter one number in the other tab and call
- Test audio communication (requires different devices for audio feedback)

## 📈 Performance & Technical Details

- **Voice Latency**: <50ms (WebRTC P2P direct connection)
- **Signaling Latency**: <100ms for call setup
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Full WebRTC support on modern mobile browsers
- **Concurrent Calls**: Limited only by server resources (currently unbounded)
- **Phone Number Format**: Singapore (+65) with 8-digit local numbers

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **End-to-end Encryption** - WebRTC DTLS/SRTP for all audio streams
- **No Audio Storage** - Server never handles or stores audio data
- **Minimal Data Collection** - Only phone numbers for call routing
- **HTTPS Required** - Production deployment requires HTTPS for WebRTC
- **ICE Servers** - Configured for NAT traversal in production

## 🎯 Business Use Cases

### Demo & Testing Platform
- **WebRTC Demonstration** - Show P2P audio capabilities
