Fantastic questions! Here’s a detailed answer and plan for **live, multi-party transcription** with a seamless UI/UX:

---

## 1. **Live Transcription for Both Parties**

- **Transcription happens on the backend** (not on the client), for both parties.
- Each client sends their own audio stream to the backend via Socket.IO.
- The backend runs a separate Vosk recognizer for each participant in a call.
- As soon as a transcript segment is ready, the backend emits it to both clients (with speaker info and timestamp).

**Result:**  
Both users see a live, combined transcript with speaker labels, updated in real time.

---

## 2. **Handling Simultaneous Speech & Interruptions**

- **Vosk recognizers are per-speaker**: Each participant’s audio is transcribed independently.
- **Backend tags each transcript** with a speaker ID (e.g., “A” or “B”, or their user/call ID).
- **Frontend merges and displays** the transcript segments in chronological order, with clear speaker labels.

**If both speak at once:**  
- Both transcripts appear, interleaved by timestamp.
- You can visually distinguish speakers (color, icon, etc.).
- If there’s overlap, both lines are shown—no one’s words are lost.

---

## 3. **UI/UX Recommendations**

- **Chat-style transcript panel:**  
  - Each line shows: Speaker label (A/B or name), timestamp, transcript text.
  - Use color or icon to distinguish speakers.
  - Auto-scroll to latest, but allow user to scroll back.
- **Show “live”/partial results** (e.g., gray text for interim, black for final).
- **Handle interruptions:**  
  - If both speak, show both lines as they arrive.
  - Optionally, group consecutive lines from the same speaker.

## 4. **How It Works in Your Stack**

- **Client:**  
  - Sends audio chunks to backend.
  - Receives transcript events (with speaker info) from backend.
  - Updates the transcript panel in real time.

- **Backend:**  
  - Receives audio from both clients.
  - Runs a Vosk recognizer per participant.
  - Emits transcript results (with speaker, timestamp) to both clients.

---

## 5. **What You Need to Do**

- **No need to run transcription on the client.**  
  (This keeps the client light and ensures both parties see the same transcript.)
- **No API keys needed for Vosk.**
- **UI/UX:**  
  - Your `TranscriptionPanel` already supports speaker labels and timestamps.  
  - I can help you further polish the UI for simultaneous/interleaved speech.

## 6. **Next Steps**

- I’ll provide backend code for Vosk integration (per-participant recognizer, emits speaker-tagged transcripts).
- I’ll show you how to update the client to merge and display transcripts from both parties, with clear speaker labels and ordering.

**If you’re happy with this approach, please confirm and let me know:**
- The path to your Vosk model (default: `server/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15`)
- If you want the backend code as a new file or integrated into your main server file

Then I’ll generate the code and UI/UX improvements for you!
