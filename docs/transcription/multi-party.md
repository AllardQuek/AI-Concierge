Your understanding is **mostly correct in terms of the ideal architecture**, but the current implementation is likely not set up that way. Let’s clarify what’s happening and what’s possible:

---

## 1. **Current Implementation (Based on Your Code)**
- **Each client (A and B) only sends their own microphone audio to the backend for transcription.**
  - When A starts transcription, A’s mic audio is sent to the backend and transcribed.
  - When B starts transcription, B’s mic audio is sent to the backend and transcribed.
- **The backend transcribes whatever audio it receives from each client, independently.**
- **The frontend displays the transcription results it receives from the backend.**

**This means:**
- If only A starts transcription, only A’s speech is transcribed (because only A’s mic audio is sent).
- If B wants their speech transcribed, B must also start transcription (so their mic audio is sent).

---

## 2. **What You Want (Ideal/Advanced Architecture)**
- **Only one party needs to start transcription.**
- **Both sides’ audio (A and B) is sent to the backend, and both are transcribed.**
- **The backend can distinguish between speakers (A vs. B) and send a combined transcript to both clients.**
- **The frontend just displays the transcript, regardless of who started it.**

---

## 3. **Why the Current Setup Doesn’t Do This**
- **WebRTC peer-to-peer audio:** In a typical WebRTC call, each client’s audio is sent directly to the other peer, not to the backend.
- **Transcription backend:** The backend only receives audio from the client that started transcription (their own mic).
- **No mixed or dual-stream transcription:** The backend does not receive both sides’ audio unless both clients send their own mic audio to the backend.

---

## 4. **How to Achieve Your Ideal Setup**

### **Option 1: Server as a Media Relay (SFU/MCU)**
- Route all audio streams through the backend (as a Selective Forwarding Unit or Media Mixing Unit).
- The backend receives both A and B’s audio, can transcribe both, and send a combined transcript.
- **Cons:** Much more complex, higher server bandwidth/cost, not typical for peer-to-peer WebRTC.

### **Option 2: Each Client Sends Their Own Audio to Backend**
- Both A and B must start transcription (send their mic audio to backend).
- The backend can tag transcripts with participant IDs.
- The frontend can merge and display the transcript for both sides.

### **Option 3: “Spy” on Remote Audio Locally**
- Each client could, in theory, capture the remote audio stream and send it to the backend for transcription.
- **Cons:** Not supported by browsers for privacy reasons (you can’t easily get the decoded remote audio as a stream).

## 5. **What’s Most Practical?**
- **Most practical:** Each client sends their own mic audio to the backend for transcription.
- **If you want a “shared” transcript:** Both A and B should start transcription, and the backend should merge transcripts by conversation ID and participant ID.
- **The frontend can then display the merged transcript to both users.**

## 6. **Summary Table**

| Who Starts Transcription | Who’s Audio is Transcribed | What’s Displayed |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Only A                  | Only A’s mic              | Only A’s speech  |
| Only B                  | Only B’s mic              | Only B’s speech  |
| Both A and B            | Both mics                 | Both speeches    |

---

## 7. **What Should You Do?**
- If you want both sides’ speech transcribed, both must start transcription.
- The backend should merge transcripts by conversation and participant.
- The frontend can display the merged transcript to both users.

---

**If you want to change this so only one party needs to start transcription and both sides’ audio is transcribed, you would need to re-architect your call flow to route all audio through the backend (SFU/MCU), which is a significant change.**
