Great! Here’s a tailored plan for **real-time transcription with a Node.js backend** that fits your requirements:

---

## 1. **Backend Integration Strategy**

- **Integrate with your existing server:**  
  Your `server/` folder already uses Node.js and Socket.IO. It’s best to add transcription support directly to this server for a unified architecture.

---

## 2. **Transcription Engine Options (Node.js)**

### **A. OpenAI Whisper (via Python subprocess or Whisper.cpp)**
- **Pros:** Very accurate, supports many languages, open-source, free to run locally.
- **Cons:** Needs a Python or C++ process; not pure Node.js, but easy to call from Node.
- **Cost:** Free if you run it on your own hardware (CPU or GPU).  
- **Best for:** POC and future production if you want to avoid API costs.

### **B. Vosk**
- **Pros:** Open-source, runs on CPU, Node.js bindings available, supports many languages.
- **Cons:** Slightly less accurate than Whisper, but very easy to integrate.
- **Cost:** Free.
- **Best for:** Fastest Node.js integration, especially for POC.

### **C. Cloud APIs (Google, AWS, Azure, Deepgram, AssemblyAI, etc.)**
- **Pros:** Easy to use, scalable, no server maintenance.
- **Cons:** Not free (beyond limited trial), can get expensive for real-time/long calls.
- **Cost:** Typically $1–$2 per hour of audio after free tier.

---

## **Recommendation for POC:**
**Start with Vosk for pure Node.js integration and zero cost.**  
If you want higher accuracy and are okay with a Python dependency, you can switch to Whisper later.

---

## 3. **Implementation Plan**

### **A. Backend (Node.js + Vosk)**
- Add Vosk to your server (via npm).
- On `transcription-audio-chunk` Socket.IO event, buffer and transcribe audio.
- Emit transcript results back to the client.

### **B. Client**
- Tap the outgoing audio stream.
- Send audio chunks to the backend via Socket.IO.
- Display incoming transcript results.
