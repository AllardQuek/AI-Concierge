- **AI Dashboard integration** - Live insights and suggested actions
- **Conversation history** - Full conversation tracking with timestamps
- **Agent-customer interaction** - Simulated back-and-forth dialogue
- **Confidence scoring** - Mock transcription confidence levels

### ðŸ“± **How to Use the Demo**

1. Switch to demo branch: `git checkout demo/mock-ai-conversation`
2. Start the application: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/agent` and login as an agent
4. The AI Dashboard sidebar shows mock insights
5. Start a call - mock conversation begins automatically after 2 seconds
6. Watch real-time transcription and AI insights update

### ðŸ’¬ **Demo Conversation Flow**
The mock includes a realistic customer service scenario:
- Customer has online banking access issues
- Agent helps with password reset
- Natural back-and-forth dialogue
- AI provides real-time insights and suggestions

## Main Branch: Real Implementation

The `main` branch focuses on **actual speech recognition** and real audio processing:
- Web Speech API integration
- Real microphone audio capture
- Actual speech-to-text conversion
- Live conversation tracking from real speech

## Branch Strategy

```
main (real speech transcription)
â”œâ”€â”€ demo/mock-ai-conversation (complete mockup)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/ai-analysis-enhancement (intelligent AI analysis)
â””â”€â”€ feature/* (future development branches)
```

### ðŸ§  **New: AI Analysis Enhancement Branch**

**Branch**: `feature/ai-analysis-enhancement`

**Purpose**: Sophisticated real-time AI analysis and conversation intelligence

**Features**:
- ðŸ”® **Oracle AI Analysis Service**: Real-time sentiment, intent, and escalation detection
- ðŸ“Š **Live Conversation Metrics**: Duration, word count, speaker balance, response times
- ðŸ’¡ **Intelligent Recommendations**: Context-aware suggestions for agents
- âœ… **Action Detection**: Automated follow-up task identification
- ðŸŽ¯ **Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive conversation insights
- ðŸ”® **Oracle Personality**: Mystical themed AI with prophetic language

**What's Different from Demo**:
- **Real Analysis Logic**: Actual sentiment and intent detection algorithms
- **Performance Optimized**: Event-driven updates, memory management
- **Production Ready**: TypeScript safety, extensible architecture
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Detailed testing scenarios and validation
- **Full Documentation**: Architecture analysis and implementation guides

This approach allows us to:
